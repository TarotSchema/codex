The light from this process takes millions of light years to reach our galaxy millions of years so it is not \\\"the present\\\" moment as we see it. The Star card in The Diary suggests that all tangible things are subject to a cycle of creation that moves at its own pace and direction. As the seeker, this card indicates that there are aspirations that are yet to be met or have already been fulfilled and it is time to either create the energy necessary for its formation; or allow it to disperse if the creation process is completed. Wishes are thoughts that are formed in the consciousness and it is up to the seeker to manifest it; or allow it to dissipate if it has already run its course. As a situation, this card suggests a time of evaluating what is required to bring about the reality one wishes to create in one's future that is eventually to form a destiny. It may also suggest that dreams are the seed that requires one's effort to manifest into reality provided the steps are taken to ensure its growth. Without first identifying the situation one wishes to create, the possibility dissipates into unfulfilled aspirations.",

The labyrinth in the middle of the star points to the search for the meaning, which by way of the heart is also a search for the centre.

The serpent is coiled up at the foot of the tree of knowledge. The yellow background emphasises the energy of the moment. Fish and water show the duality again and the produced flow of energy.

The dominating yellow in the picture depicts joy of living. The water at the bottom indicates frankness or naivety, but also emotions to be conquered, such as caution or fear. Black and white reins, held in the right and left hand, show different directions and ambivalences, which have to be brought into harmony to make the journey possible. The next part of the journey, which lies ahead of the coach driver, the material world, represented by green, square fields, opens up within all this. Libra's symbol (justice) shows that one has to reckon with consequences for any mistakes. The section at the top leads into the night. The coach driver does not encounter the sun, as to be expected, but instead the moon and stars. He will meet intuition and the unconscious.",

The picture's spirals in the trees, path and window turn in different directions and refer to the inward course. This can be consciously taken, turning to the right, or intuitively, turning to the left. The Hermit finds his light in the safety of the house.

The violet colour of the wall also shows a penetration of the colours red and blue. The trees also contain this mixture of the elements, but they are growing cautiously as well as the clouds, water, which so to speak, becomes air (gaseous). They also stand for integration, which on the one hand makes us more flexible but on the other hand obscures things.

The three tombstones show the headgear of the pope, the king and the farmer. At death there is no difference. The skeleton's hand comes from the left and holds a blue scythe, which seems to be a mixture between a sceptre and a sword. The leaf, which is growing out of it, shows that death, due to its quality allowing old things to fade away, makes new growth possible. The water symbolises the river Styx, which has to be crossed at death so as to reach the next world. The colour blue in the picture stands for disconnection and purification. Like its younger brother sleep, death also has a cleansing property, which is particularly emphasised by the whiteness of the skeleton's hand and the blade of the scythe. What is interesting (I only realised later) is that the scythe's blade itself gives the hint of a crescent moon.",

Above his head is the mysterious sign of the Holy Spirit, the sign of life, like an endless cord, forming the figure eight in a horizontal position. About his waist is a serpent-cincture, the serpent appearing to devour its own tail. This is familiar to most as a conventional symbol of eternity, but here it indicates more especially the eternity of attainment in the spirit. In the Magician's right hand is a wand raised towards heaven, while the left hand is pointing to the earth. This dual sign is known in very high grades of the Instituted Mysteries; it shews the descent of grace, virtue and light, drawn from things above and derived to things below. The suggestion throughout is therefore the possession and communication of the Powers and Gifts of the Spirit. On the table in front of the Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits, signifying the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills. Beneath are roses and lilies, the flos campi and lilium convallium, changed into garden flowers, to shew the culture of aspiration. This card signifies the divine motive in man, reflecting God, the will in the liberation of its union with that which is above. It is also the unity of individual being on all planes, and in a very high sense it is thought, in the fixation thereof. With further reference to what I have called the sign of life and its connexion with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change unto the Ogdoad. The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to Martinism, eight is the number of Christ. Divinatory Meaning: Skill, diplomacy, address, subtlety; sickness, pain, loss, disaster, snares of enemies; self-confidence, will; the Querent, if male.",

The scroll in her hands is inscribed with the word Tora, signifying the Greater Law, the Secret Law and the second sense of the Word. It is partly covered by her mantle, to shew that some things are implied and some spoken. She is seated between the white and black pillars – J. and B. – of the mystic Temple, and the veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palms and pomegranates. The vestments are flowing and gauzy, and the mantle suggests light – a shimmering radiance. She has been called occult Science on the threshold of the Sanctuary of Isis, but she is really the Secret Church, the House which is of God and man. She represents also the Second Marriage of the Prince who is no longer of this world; she is the spiritual Bride and Mother, the daughter of the stars and the Higher Garden of Eden. She is, in fine, the Queen of the borrowed light, but this is the light of all. She is the Moon nourished by the milk of the Supernal Mother. In a manner, she is also the Supernal Mother herself – that is to say, she is the bright reflection. It is in this sense of reflection that her truest and highest name in bolism is Shekinah – the co-habiting glory. According to Kabalism, there is a Shekinah both above and below. In the superior world it is called Binah, the Supernal Understanding which reflects to the emanations that are beneath. In the lower world it is MaIkuth – that world being, for this purpose, understood as a blessed Kingdom that with which it is made blessed being the Indwelling Glory. Mystically speaking, the Shekinah is the Spiritual Bride of the just man, and when he reads the Law she gives the Divine meaning. There are some respects in which this card is the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana. Divinatory Meaning: Secrets, mystery, the future as yet unrevealed; the woman who interests the Querent, if male; the Querent herself, if female; silence, tenacity; mystery, wisdom, science.",

The symbol of Venus is on the shield which rests near her. A field of corn is ripening in front of her, and beyond there is a fall of water. The sceptre which she bears is surmounted by the globe of this world. She is the inferior Garden of Eden, the Earthly Paradise, all that is symbolised by the visible house of man. She is not Regina coeli, but she is still refugium peccatorum, the fruitful mother of thousands. There are also certain aspects in which she has been correctly described as desire and the wings thereof, as the woman clothed with the sun, as Gloria Mundi and the veil of the Sanctum Sanctorum; but she is not, I may add, the soul that has attained wings, unless all the symbolism is counted up another and unusual way. She is, above all things, universal fecundity and the outer sense of the Word. This is obvious, because there is no direct message which has been given to man like that which is borne by woman; but she does not herself carry its interpretation. In another order of ideas, the card of the Empress signifies the door or gate by which an entrance is obtained into this life, as into the Garden of Venus; and then the way which leads out therefrom, into that which is beyond, is the secret known to the High Priestess: it is communicated by her to the elect. Most old attributions of this card are completely wrong on the symbolism – as, for example, its identification with the Word, Divine Nature, the Triad, and so forth. Divinatory Meaning: Fruitfulness, action, initiative, length of days; the unknown, clandestine; also, difficulty, doubt, ignorance.",

He is executive and realisation, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes. He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues. He is the virile power, to which the Empress responds, and in this sense is he who seeks to remove the Veil of Isis; yet she remains virgo intacta. It should be understood that this card and that of the Empress do not precisely represent the condition of married life, though this state is implied. On the surface, as I have indicated, they stand for mundane royalty, uplifted on the seats of the mighty; but above this there is the suggestion of another presence. They signify also – and the male figure especially – the higher kingship, occupying the intellectual throne. Hereof is the lordship of thought rather than of the animal world. Both personalities, after their own manner, are full of strange experience, but theirs is not consciously the wisdom which draws from a higher world. The Emperor has been described as (a) will in its embodied form, but this is only one of its applications, and (b) as an expression of virtualities contained in the Absolute Being – but this is fantasy.

In his left hand he holds a sceptre terminating in the triple cross, and with his right hand he gives the well-known ecclesiastical sign which is called that of esotericism, distinguishing between the manifest and concealed part of doctrine. It is noticeable in this connexion that the High Priestess makes no sign. At his feet are the crossed keys, and two priestly ministers in albs kneel before him. He has been usually called the Pope, which is a particular application of the more general office that he symbolises. He is the ruling power of external religion, as the High Priestess is the prevailing genius of the esoteric, withdrawn power. The proper meanings of this card have suffered woeful admixture from nearly all hands. Grand Orient says truly that the Hierophant is the power of the keys, exoteric orthodox doctrine, and the outer side of the life which leads to the doctrine; but he is certainly not the prince of occult doctrine, as another commentator has suggested. He is rather the summa totius theologiae, when it has passed into the utmost rigidity of expression; but he symbolises also all things that are righteous and sacred on the manifest side. As such, he is the channel of grace belonging to the world of institution as distinct from that of Nature, and he is the leader of salvation for the human race at large. He is the order and the head of the recognised hierarchy, which is the reflection of another and greater hierarchic order; but it may so happen that the pontiff forgets the significance of this his symbolic state and acts as if he contained within his proper measures all that his sign signifies or his symbol seeks to shew forth. He is not, as it has been thought, philosophy – except on the theological side; he is not inspiration; and he is not religion, although he is a mode of its expression. Divinatory Meaning: Marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude; by another account, mercy and goodness; inspiration; the man to whom the Querent has recourse.",

Behind the man is the Tree of Life, bearing twelve fruits, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is behind the woman; the serpent is twining round it. The figures suggest youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire. This is in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life. It replaces, by recourse to first principles, the old card of marriage, which I have described previously, and the later follies which depicted man between vice and virtue. In a very high sense, the card is a mystery of the Covenant and Sabbath. The suggestion in respect of the woman is that she signifies that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man, but she is rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress. It is through her imputed lapse that man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself. The card is therefore in its way another intimation concerning the great mystery of womanhood. The old meanings fall to pieces of necessity with the old pictures, but even as interpretations of the latter, some of them were of the order of commonplace and others were false in symbolism.

          "description": "A woman, over whose head there broods the same symbol of life which we have seen in the card of the Magician, is closing the jaws of a lion. The only point in which this design differs from the conventional presentations is that her beneficent fortitude has already subdued the lion, which is being led by a chain of flowers. For reasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with that of justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation carries nothing with it which will signify to the reader, there is no cause for explanation. Fortitude, in one of its most exalted aspects, is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union; the virtue, of course, operates in all planes, and hence draws on all in its symbolism. It connects also with innocentia inviolata, and with the strength which resides in contemplation. These higher meanings are, however, matters of inference, and I do not suggest that they are transparent on the surface of the card. They are intimated in a concealed manner by the chain of flowers, which signifies, among many other things, the sweet yoke and the light burden of Divine Law, when it has been taken into the heart of hearts. The card has nothing to do with self-confidence in the ordinary sense, though this has been suggested – but it concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God, who have found their refuge in Him. There is one aspect in which the lion signifies the passions, and she who is called Strength is the higher nature in its liberation. It has walked upon the asp and the basilisk and has trodden down the lion and the dragon. Divinatory Meaning: Power, energy, action, courage, magnanimity; also, complete success and honours.",

I have said that this is a card of attainment, and to extend this conception the figure is seen holding up his beacon on an eminence. Therefore, the Hermit is not, as Court de Gebelin explained, a wise man in search of truth and justice; nor is he, as a later explanation proposes, an especial example of experience. His beacon intimates that – where I am, you also may be. It is further a card which is understood quite incorrectly when it is connected with the idea of occult isolation, as the protection of personal magnetism against admixture. This is one of the frivolous renderings which we owe to Eliphas Levi. It has been adopted by the French Order of Martinism and some of us have heard a great deal of the Silent and Unknown Philosophy enveloped by his mantle from the knowledge of the profane. In true Martinism, the significance of the term Philosophe inconnu was of another order. It did not refer to the intended concealment of the Instituted Mysteries, much less of their substitutes, but – like the card itself – to the truth that the Divine Mysteries secure their own protection from those who are unprepared. Divinatory Meaning: Prudence, circumspection; also and especially treason, dissimulation, roguery, corruption.",

With the French occultist, and in the design itself, the symbolic picture stands for the perpetual motion of a fluidic universe and for the flux of human life. The Sphinx is the equilibrium therein. The transliteration of Taro as Rota is inscribed on the wheel, counter changed with the letters of the Divine Name – to shew that Providence is imphed through all. But this is the Divine intention within, and the similar intention without is exemplified by the four Living Creatures. Sometimes the sphinx is represented couchant on a pedestal above, which defrauds the symbolism by stultifying the essential idea of stability amidst movement. Behind the general notion expressed in the symbol there lies the denial of chance and the fatality which is implied therein. It may be added that, from the days of Levi onward, the occult explanations of this card are – even for occultism itself – of a singularly fatuous kind. It has been said to mean principle, fecundity, virile honour, ruling authority, etc. The findings of common fortune-telling are better than this on their own plane.

The latter belongs to a mysterious order of Providence, in virtue of which it is possible for certain men to conceive the idea of dedication to the highest things. The operation of this is like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills, and we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it. It is analogous to the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, and their presence is as much a mystery as their absence. The law of Justice is not however involved by either alternative. In conclusion, the pillars of Justice open into one world and the pillars of the High Priestess into another.

It expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe. He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Mystery of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection.

Behind it lies the whole world of ascent in the spirit. The mysterious horseman moves slowly, bearing a black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose, which signifies life. Between two pillars on the verge of the horizon there shines the sun of immortality. The horseman carries no visible weapon, but king and child and maiden fall before him, while a prelate with clasped hands awaits his end. There should be no need to point out that the suggestion of death which I have made in connection with the previous card is, of course, to be understood mystically, but this is not the case in the present instance. The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being either is or may be one form of his progress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate. The existing occult explanations of the 13th card are, on the whole, better than usual, rebirth, creation, destination, renewal, and the rest. Divinatory Meaning: End, mortality, destruction, corruption also, for a man, the loss of a benefactor for a woman, many contrarieties; for a maid, failure of marriage projects.",

In the left hand there is a great flaming torch, inverted towards the earth. A reversed pentagram is on the forehead. There is a ring in front of the altar, from which two chains are carried to the necks of two figures, male and female. These are analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall. Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life. The figures are tailed, to signify the animal nature, but there is human intelligence in the faces, and he who is exalted above them is not to be their master for ever. Even now, he is also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him and blind to the liberty of service. With more than his usual derision for the arts which he pretended to respect and interpret as a master therein, Eliphas Levi affirms that the Baphometic figure is occult science and magic. Another commentator says that in the Divine world it signifies predestination, but there is no correspondence in that world with the things which below are of the brute. What it does signify is the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the forbidden fruit.

It is idle to indicate that it depicts min in all its aspects, because it bears this evidence on the surface. It is said further that it contains the first allusion to a material building, but I do not conceive that the Tower is more or less material than the pillars which we have met with in three previous cases. I see nothing to warrant Papus in supposing that it is literally the fall of Adam, but there is more in favour of his alternative – that it signifies the materialisation of the spiritual word. The bibliographer Christian imagines that it is the downfall of the mind, seeking to penetrate the mystery of God. I agree rather with Grand Orient that it is the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein, and above all that it is the rending of a House of Doctrine. I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood. It illustrates also in the most comprehensive way the old truth that – except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. There is a sense in which the catastrophe is a reflection from the previous card, but not on the side of the symbolism which I have tried to indicate therein. It is more correctly a question of analogy; one is concerned with the fall into the material and animal state, while the other signifies destruction on the intellectual side. The Tower has been spoken of as the chastisement of pride and the intellect overwhelmed in the attempt to penetrate the Mystery of God; but in neither case do these explanations account for the two persons who are the living sufferers. The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation. In yet a deeper sense, it may signify also the end of a dispensation, but there is no possibility here for the consideration of this involved question. Divinatory Meaning: Misery, distress, indigence, adversity, calamity, disgrace, deception, ruin. It is a card in particular of unforeseen catastrophe.",

The dog and wolf are the fears of the natural mind in the presence of that place of exit, when there is only reflected light to guide it. The last reference is a key to another form of symbolism. The intellectual light is a reflection and beyond it is the unknown mystery which it cannot shew forth. It illuminates our animal nature, types of which are represented below – the dog, the wolf and that which comes up out of the deeps, the nameless and hideous tendency which is lower than the savage beast. It strives to attain manifestation, symbolised by crawling from the abyss of water to the land, but as a rule it sinks back whence it came. The face of the mind directs a calm gaze upon the unrest below; the dew of thought falls; the message is: Peace, be still; and it may be that there shall come a calm upon the animal nature, while the abyss beneath shall cease from giving up a form.

The card signifies, therefore, the transit from the manifest light of this world, represented by the glorious sun of earth, to the light of the world to come, which goes before aspiration and is typified by the heart of a child. But the last allusion is again the key to a different form or aspect of the symbolism. The sun is that of consciousness in the spirit – the direct as the antithesis of the reflected light. The characteristic type of humanity has become a little child therein – a child in the sense of simplicity and innocence in the sense of wisdom. In that simplicity, he bears the seal of Nature and of Art; in that innocence, he signifies the restored world.

It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit. But these meanings are without prejudice to that which I have said concerning it on the material side. It has more than one message on the macrocosmic side and is, for example, the state of the restored world when the law of manifestation shall have been carried to the highest degree of natural perfection. But it is perhaps more especially a story of the past, referring to that day when all was declared to be good, when the morning stars sang together and all the Sons of God shouted for joy. One of the worst explanations concerning it is that the figure symbolises the Magus when he has reached the highest degree of initiation; another account says that it represents the absolute, which is ridiculous.

          "description": "With light step, as if earth and its trammels had little power to restrain him, a young man in gorgeous vestments pauses at the brink of a precipice among the great heights of the world; he surveys the blue distance before him – its expanse of sky rather than the prospect below. His act of eager walking is still indicated, though he is stationary at the given moment; his dog is still bounding. The edge which opens on the depth has no terror; it is as if angels were waiting to uphold him, if it came about that he leaped from the height. His countenance is full of intelligence and expectant dream. He has a rose in one hand and in the other a costly wand, from which depends over his right shoulder a wallet curiously embroidered. He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one – all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air. The sun, which shines behind him, knows whence he came, whither he is going, and how he will return by another path after many days. He is the spirit in search of experience. Many symbols of the Instituted Mysteries are summarised in this card, which reverses, under high warrants, all the confusions that have preceded it. In his Manual of Cartomancy, Grand Orient has a curious suggestion of the office of Mystic Fool, as apart of his process in higher divination; but it might call for more than ordinary gifts to put it into operation. We shall see how the card fares according to the common arts of fortune-telling, and it will be an example, to those who can discern, of the fact, otherwise so evident, that the Trumps Major had no place originally in the arts of psychic gambling, when cards are used as the counters and pretexts. Of the circumstances under which this art arose we know, however, very little. The conventional explanations say that the Fool signifies the flesh, the sensitive life, and by a peculiar satire its subsidiary name was at one time the alchemist, as depicting folly at the most insensate stage. Divinatory Meaning: Folly, mania, extravagance, intoxication, delirium, frenzy, bewrayment.",

The card features five swords arranged in a dynamic, chaotic pattern, with broken blades and a sense of turbulence. This design symbolises the intellectual or mental anguish that follows a destructive confrontation. The Venus in Aquarius influence adds a layer of detachment and the coldness of rationality, as victory here may come at the cost of relationships or the integrity of one's ideals. The imagery implies that the battle was fought without true understanding or empathy, and any success gained feels unfulfilling. This card is a cautionary message about the nature of conflict and the price of victory. It encourages reflection on whether the victory is worth the emotional toll and whether the ego-driven approach has led to isolation. It warns of the potential for self-deception, where the illusion of winning overshadows the deeper consequences of discord. The Five of Swords highlights the danger of intellectual arrogance, encouraging a re-evaluation of motivations and the long-term effects of strife.

This card represents mental interference, where over-analysis and conflicting thoughts prevent you from making decisions. The swords, each different in type, further emphasise the scattering and disorganisation of the mind, leading to a sense of being trapped by one's own thoughts, perhaps an inner critic. The Jupiter in Gemini influence indicates mental expansion, but with a dualistic nature that leads to indecision. The card suggests that although you may feel restricted, the limitations are often self-imposed by an inability to focus or make a choice. While the potential for resolution exists, breaking free from this mental entrapment requires clarity and a shift in perspective to gain control over scattered thoughts and find the right course of action. In Relationships: The Eight of Swords may indicate feelings of entrapment or restriction. You may feel as if you are stuck in a mental prison, unable to break free from negative thought patterns or emotional ties. It suggests that you must confront your limiting beliefs to move forward.

It suggests you may feel trapped by circumstances or your own thoughts, but the solution lies in breaking free from these mental constraints.

This stark imagery symbolises mental torment, anguish, and the destructive nature of obsessive thoughts. The swords are arranged in a neat, symmetrical pattern, creating a sense of overwhelming confinement. The dripping blood adds an element of suffering, underscoring the emotional pain that often accompanies mental distress. The Mars in Gemini influence links this card to the struggle of the mind—Mars, the planet of aggression and conflict, is paired with Gemini, the sign of duality and scattered thought. This combination reflects mental cruelty: the mind in conflict, torn between multiple, often contradictory thoughts, leading to heightened anxiety and self-inflicted pain. The Nine of Swords indicates that the distress is exaggerated and often caused by the inability to control overactive, fearful thinking. This card suggests you may be trapped by your mind, but relief comes with confronting these fears and breaking free from the cycle of overthinking. In Relationships: The Nine of Swords indicates excessive worry or anxiety, maybe stemming from irrational fears or doubts. It suggests your mind is clouded by negative thinking, and you may be overly focused on problems that have not yet materialised. The card urges you to confront your fears and seek clarity, as the situation may not be as dire as you believe. In Work: The Nine of Swords indicates mental stress, burnout, or overwhelming worry about the future. It suggests a period of sleeplessness, anxiety over work-related issues, or a fear of failure. The card advises you to address your mental health and seek help if needed, as the stress may be disproportionate to the actual situation. Spiritually: The Nine of Swords represents despair or inner conflict. It suggests your mind is filled with self-doubt, fear, or confusion, preventing spiritual progress. The card calls for mental healing and the release of unnecessary worry to create space for inner peace and clarity. When ill-dignified: The Nine of Swords can indicate a worsening of mental anguish, where you cannot break free from obsessive thoughts or fears. It may suggest depression, overwhelming anxiety, or hopelessness, where the mind is trapped in a cycle of negative thinking.",

This imagery emphasises the breakdown of old thought patterns and the finality of a challenging mental cycle. This card represents a moment of intense closure, often following conflict, betrayal, or harsh mental realisations. However, it is not merely a card of defeat—it marks the end of a chapter and the potential for renewal. The swords' placement in the Tree of Life suggests that the end of one cycle clears the way for new understanding and growth. Though the situation may feel like a dramatic loss, it carries the seed for transformation, indicating that closure creates space for new possibilities.

A skeletal figure on horseback with a scythe reminds us that change is inevitable and letting go of the old makes room for the new. It signifies the natural cycle of life, where death is a transition, not an end. This card calls for releasing what no longer serves, allowing you to shed old habits or beliefs holding you back from growth. Death may appear when you face a period of significant change or the need to release attachments. It encourages you to embrace these transitions with trust and understanding, knowing that they are part of the cycles of life. The end of something can be an opportunity for renewal, as old patterns give way to new possibilities. Death is not to be feared but embraced as a natural part of the journey of life. In Relationships: Death signifies the end of a phase, which could be a breakup, a transformation in how two people relate, or letting go of old patterns that no longer work. This card indicates that the relationship may be going through a period of change, and it encourages you to embrace that change rather than resist it. Death invites rebirth—whether the opportunity to renew the relationship by letting go of baggage or the possibility of closing the chapter to make space for new, healthier connections. This card reminds us that endings, though painful, are necessary for growth and new beginnings. In Work: Death signifies a major transformation, signalling the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. It may indicate the closing of a professional project, a career change, or a shift in goals or direction. While this may initially feel unsettling, Death suggests this change is an opportunity for growth through an alternative career path, a different role, or a fresh approach to work. This card encourages you to release old ways of working or thinking that no longer serve you and embrace the unknown with an open mind. Death signals that sometimes it's necessary to let go of the old to make space for new opportunities and success. Spiritually: Death represents the ultimate transformation, the shedding of old identities, and the continual evolution of the soul. This card speaks to the process of spiritual rebirth, where you may be called to let go of outdated beliefs or practices that no longer resonate with your higher self. It encourages you to embrace the process of spiritual evolution, where each phase of life offers the opportunity to transform and grow in new ways. Death invites the seeker to release the attachments that bind them to the material world and focus on inner growth, understanding that spiritual evolution is a continual process of shedding and renewal.",

A powerful, frightening figure symbolises the internal and external forces that trap us in cycles of desire, fear, and self-doubt. This card is about the darker side of human nature—the impulses, obsessions, and habits that may seem alluring at the moment but ultimately prevent growth and freedom. The chains are loosely fitted on the figures, suggesting that the freedom to break free from these constraints is possible, but only when you recognise your own power and the nature of your attachments. The Devil encourages you to examine where you may be giving away your personal power, whether through unhealthy relationships, addiction, material desires, or limiting beliefs. It calls attention to areas where you may feel stuck or trapped by your own choices, urging you to face these shadow aspects head-on to free yourself from the influence of fear and negative patterns.

          "description": "Astrological Correspondence: Venus in Aquarius The Five of Swords represents the complexities of conflict, often showing the aftermath of a battle where the victor is left with a hollow triumph. The card features five swords arranged in a dynamic, chaotic pattern, with broken blades and a sense of turbulence. This design symbolises the intellectual or mental anguish that follows a destructive confrontation. The Venus in Aquarius influence adds a layer of detachment and the coldness of rationality, as victory here may come at the cost of relationships or the integrity of one's ideals. The imagery implies that the battle was fought without true understanding or empathy, and any success gained feels unfulfilling. This card is a cautionary message about the nature of conflict and the price of victory. It encourages reflection on whether the victory is worth the emotional toll and whether the ego-driven approach has led to isolation. It warns of the potential for self-deception, where the illusion of winning overshadows the deeper consequences of discord. The Five of Swords highlights the danger of intellectual arrogance, encouraging a re-evaluation of motivations and the long-term effects of strife. In Relationships: In a romantic context, the Five of Swords can indicate conflict, betrayal, or disagreements that may lead to emotional hurt. The card suggests that intellectual or verbal battles have damaged the relationship or one person has 'won' at the expense of another. It can signify a need for resolution and forgiveness, or the decision to exit a toxic situation. In Work: The Five of Swords may represent a loss or failure because of conflict in the workplace. It could indicate a competitive atmosphere where you win but feel morally compromised or defeated, even if you technically 'won'. This card warns of the mental toll of rivalry and deceit. Spiritually: The Five of Swords indicates inner conflict, where your mind is in turmoil. It suggests a time when your intellectual pursuits may have become disconnected from your higher purpose, and ego-driven struggles interfere with spiritual peace. When ill-dignified: The Five of Swords represents destructive conflict, where your thoughts and actions are driven by ego, and victory is hollow or short-lived. It may suggest manipulation, deceit, or a situation where you have 'lost' even if you technically won. The mental energy is consumed in futile struggles, leaving you with no actual sense of fulfilment.",

The swords' arrangement creates a sense of imbalance, indicating confusion, strategy gone awry, or mental conflict. The large sword in the centre represents a central issue or challenge, while the six surrounding swords suggest attempts at intellectual or strategic action that fail to resolve the problem. The Moon in Aquarius influence brings emotional confusion or distorted perceptions, where rational thought may be clouded by fears or hidden motives. This card points to the futility of relying solely on cleverness or deceit to solve problems. Instead, it urges you to face the situation directly, as manipulation is unlikely to bring lasting resolution. The Seven of Swords warns of misdirected efforts, cautioning you to know the consequences of trying to escape or avoid the truth through deceit or cunning. It signals a time of reassessment, urging a clearer, more honest approach to mental challenges. In Relationships: The Seven of Swords may suggest dishonesty, hidden motives, or the need for careful communication. It could indicate that one partner is concealing something important, or a relationship is built on mind games. The card calls for transparency and openness to avoid betrayal or misunderstanding. In Work: The Seven of Swords may indicate that you are using strategy, perhaps even deceit, to achieve success. It suggests a need to be cautious of the ethics of your actions, as victory gained through dishonesty can be short-lived. Alternatively, the card may indicate a situation where you are being strategic, working behind the scenes to plan for future success. Spiritually: The Seven of Swords indicates a need for discernment and caution. It may signify a situation where you are hiding your true spiritual intentions or are not being entirely honest with yourself. The card urges you to confront secrets or falsehoods to achieve spiritual clarity. When ill-dignified: The Seven of Swords can signify outright deception, manipulation, or betrayal.

These smaller swords are arranged in two sets: three pointing left and three pointing right, symbolising conflicting mental forces and confusion. This card represents mental interference, where over-analysis and conflicting thoughts prevent you from making decisions. The swords, each different in type, further emphasise the scattering and disorganisation of the mind, leading to a sense of being trapped by one's own thoughts, perhaps an inner critic. The Jupiter in Gemini influence indicates mental expansion, but with a dualistic nature that leads to indecision. The card suggests that although you may feel restricted, the limitations are often self-imposed by an inability to focus or make a choice. While the potential for resolution exists, breaking free from this mental entrapment requires clarity and a shift in perspective to gain control over scattered thoughts and find the right course of action. In Relationships: The Eight of Swords may indicate feelings of entrapment or restriction. You may feel as if you are stuck in a mental prison, unable to break free from negative thought patterns or emotional ties. It suggests that you must confront your limiting beliefs to move forward. In Work: The Eight of Swords can indicate mental barriers, such as self-doubt, lack of confidence, or feeling restricted in one's career. It suggests you may feel trapped by circumstances or your own thoughts, but the solution lies in breaking free from these mental constraints. Spiritually: The Eight of Swords signifies a state of mental paralysis, where you cannot move forward on your spiritual journey because of fear, confusion, or negative thinking. It calls for you to recognise your own role in creating limitations and take action to break free from the mental constraints that prevent growth. When ill-dignified: The Eight of Swords may indicate a deeper sense of entrapment, where you resist change or refuse to see a way out of your mental struggles. It suggests a state of greater isolation, fear, or hopelessness, and warns that your own thinking exaggerates these feelings.",

This stark imagery symbolises mental torment, anguish, and the destructive nature of obsessive thoughts. The swords are arranged in a neat, symmetrical pattern, creating a sense of overwhelming confinement. The dripping blood adds an element of suffering, underscoring the emotional pain that often accompanies mental distress. The Mars in Gemini influence links this card to the struggle of the mind—Mars, the planet of aggression and conflict, is paired with Gemini, the sign of duality and scattered thought. This combination reflects mental cruelty: the mind in conflict, torn between multiple, often contradictory thoughts, leading to heightened anxiety and self-inflicted pain. The Nine of Swords indicates that the distress is exaggerated and often caused by the inability to control overactive, fearful thinking. This card suggests you may be trapped by your mind, but relief comes with confronting these fears and breaking free from the cycle of overthinking. In Relationships: The Nine of Swords indicates excessive worry or anxiety, maybe stemming from irrational fears or doubts. It suggests your mind is clouded by negative thinking, and you may be overly focused on problems that have not yet materialised. The card urges you to confront your fears and seek clarity, as the situation may not be as dire as you believe. In Work: The Nine of Swords indicates mental stress, burnout, or overwhelming worry about the future. It suggests a period of sleeplessness, anxiety over work-related issues, or a fear of failure. The card advises you to address your mental health and seek help if needed, as the stress may be disproportionate to the actual situation. Spiritually: The Nine of Swords represents despair or inner conflict. It suggests your mind is filled with self-doubt, fear, or confusion, preventing spiritual progress. The card calls for mental healing and the release of unnecessary worry to create space for inner peace and clarity. When ill-dignified: The Nine of Swords can indicate a worsening of mental anguish, where you cannot break free from obsessive thoughts or fears. It may suggest depression, overwhelming anxiety, or hopelessness, where the mind is trapped in a cycle of negative thinking.",

This card represents a moment of intense closure, often following conflict, betrayal, or harsh mental realisations. However, it is not merely a card of defeat—it marks the end of a chapter and the potential for renewal. The swords' placement in the Tree of Life suggests that the end of one cycle clears the way for new understanding and growth. Though the situation may feel like a dramatic loss, it carries the seed for transformation, indicating that closure creates space for new possibilities.

Though an awareness of the facts may be present, you may be ignoring them or moving around or sitting still afraid of facing them. Most probably the solution and / or course of action is present. You may be refusing to see the solution. The solution may be so big and there and present that you aren't seeing it out of the blind spot of comfortable expectations."
